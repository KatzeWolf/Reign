### The Final Hunt

From Tomorrow Night (Saturday) at 7pm AEST/ 9pm NZT Final will be Platooning with two Volunteers (BlackBill & FunkyMonkey) These two will act as his Body Guards in Random Battles on the ANZ server. We will be doing Count ins in the Public Voice Channel with which I invite you all to join us. The Tiers will be Random or can be selected through the Chat.

How this is Going to work is: You can team up in a Platoon, Kill him and share the winnings between yourselves OR you can go it alone and try kill me by yourself and keep the winnings all to yourself. Fighting past his BodyGuards of Course! ;)

The Prize Per Kill will be 150 ![this screenshot](/assets/gold.png). This can either go to one person (Solo) or be spread amongst 2-3 Platoon mates (Platoon) This will allow for at least 4 Rounds of this.
